            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>InLearn was born from a simple yet powerful belief: every student deserves access to quality educational resources, regardless of their abilities or learning differences. Founded by a team of passionate educators, special education specialists, and technology innovators, we recognized the critical gap in accessible, inclusive educational content.</p>
            <p>What started as a small collection of adapted materials has grown into a comprehensive digital ecosystem serving thousands of educators and millions of students worldwide. Our platform represents years of research, collaboration with educational institutions, and feedback from the very educators and students we serve.</p>
